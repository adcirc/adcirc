Maxrs.63: Maximum Wave Radiation Stress
=======================================

See :doc:`Maximum and Minimum Value Files <maxmin63>` for detailed documentation of the file format and structure.

This file records the maximum wave radiation stress at each node throughout the simulation. The values represent the highest wave-induced forces experienced at each node during the model run, which is important for understanding wave-current interactions and their effects on coastal processes.
