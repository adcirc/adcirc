Maxvel.63: Maximum Depth-averaged Velocity
==========================================

See :doc:`Maximum and Minimum Value Files <maxmin63>` for detailed documentation of the file format and structure.

This file records the maximum depth-averaged velocity magnitude at each node throughout the simulation. The values represent the highest velocity reached at each node during the model run, which is particularly useful for analyzing flow patterns and potential erosion risks.
