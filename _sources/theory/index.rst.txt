Theory and Formulation
======================

The theoretical foundation and mathematical formulation of ADCIRC is documented in the following report:

    `Formulation and Numerical Implementation of the 2D/3D ADCIRC Finite Element Model Version 44.XX (PDF) <https://adcirc.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2255/2018/11/adcirc_theory_2004_12_08.pdf>`_

Recent updates and enhancements to the ADCIRC model's theoretical formulation are documented throughout the pages of this documentation site. Some of the updates are documented in :doc:`../user_guide/special_features/index`.
