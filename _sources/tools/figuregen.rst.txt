FigureGen
=========

FigureGen is a visualization tool for ADCIRC model outputs developed by the Coastal & Computational Hydraulics Team at North Carolina State University. It converts ADCIRC model data into raster formats suitable for visualization and analysis, allowing users to create high-quality images and animations from simulation results.

Features
--------

* **Raster Generation**: Convert ADCIRC unstructured mesh outputs to regular grid formats
* **Multiple Output Types**: Support for various ADCIRC output files including water levels, currents, and wave data
* **Image Formats**: Generate visualizations in multiple formats including GeoTIFF, PNG, and KMZ
* **Customizable Display**: Options for color scales, contour intervals, and visual presentation
* **Batch Processing**: Process multiple time steps or datasets in a single operation
* **Domain Flexibility**: Define custom visualization domains and resolutions
* **Coordinate Systems**: Support for multiple coordinate and projection systems
