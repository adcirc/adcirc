Floodwater
==========

Floodwater is a modern and extensible forecasting system for use with hydrodynamic models such as ADCIRC. It has been designed to operate in high performance computing environments and works in tandem with the MetGet system. The system utilizes the ecFlow workflow controller and has been tested on large NSF funded supercomputers, small clusters, and within cloud computing environments.

**Key Features:**

* Modern and extensible forecasting system architecture
* Designed for high performance computing environments
* Works in tandem with the MetGet system
* Utilizes the ecFlow workflow controller
* Compatible with various computing environments (supercomputers, clusters, cloud)
