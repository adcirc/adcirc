Tools
=====

ADCIRC users can benefit from various tools that support ADCIRC to assist with pre-processing, mesh generation, model setup, post-processing, and visualization. This page provides links to documentation for several popular tools used by the ADCIRC community.

ADCIRC Utility Programs
-----------------------

The `ADCIRC utilities webpage <https://adcirc.org/home/related-software/adcirc-utility-programs/>`_ hosts a wide range of basic and advanced tools that have been developed by the ADCIRC community over the years, including ``f13builder`` to create nodal attributes and the :ref:`fort.13 file <fort13>`.
