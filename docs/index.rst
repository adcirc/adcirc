ADCIRC Model Documentation
==========================

Welcome to the ADCIRC (ADvanced CIRCulation) model documentation. The ADCIRC model is a system of computer programs for solving time dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two and three dimensions. These programs utilize the finite element method in space allowing the use of highly flexible, unstructured grids.
