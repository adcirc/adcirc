Fort.54: Depth-averaged Velocity Harmonic Constituents at All Nodes in the Model Grid
=====================================================================================

Amplitude and phase information obtained from harmonic analysis of the velocity solution at all nodes in the grid for the frequencies specified in the :doc:`Model Parameter and Periodic Boundary Condition File <../input_files/fort15>`.

File Structure
--------------

The basic file structure is shown below. Each line of output is represented by a line containing the output variable name(s). Loops indicate multiple lines of output.

.. parsed-literal::

   :ref:`NFREQ <NFREQ>`
   for k = 1, :ref:`NFREQ <NFREQ>`
      :ref:`HAFREQ(k) <HAFREQ>`, :ref:`HAFF(k) <HAFF>`, :ref:`HAFACE(k) <HAFACE>`, :ref:`NAMEFR(k) <NAMEFR>`
   end k loop
