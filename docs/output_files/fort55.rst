Fort.55: Harmonic Constituent Diagnostic Output at All Nodes in the Model Grid
==============================================================================

Comparison between the mean and variance of the elevation and velocity time series generated by the model and the mean and variance of a time series resynthesized from the computed harmonic constituents. This gives an indication of how complete the harmonic analysis was.

File Structure
--------------

The basic file structure is shown below. Each line of output is represented by a line containing the output variable name(s). Loops indicate multiple lines of output.
