Fort.63: Elevation Time Series at All Nodes in the Model Grid
=============================================================

The fort.63 file contains the water surface elevation time series output at all nodes in the model grid. This file is generated when time series output is enabled for the entire model domain. It is one of the most important output files generated by ADCIRC.

File Structure
--------------

The basic file structure is shown below. Each line of output is represented by a line containing the output variable name(s). Loops indicate multiple lines of output.

.. parsed-literal::

   :ref:`RUNDES <RUNDES>`, :ref:`RUNID <RUNID>`, :ref:`AGRID <AGRID>`
   :ref:`NDSETSE <NDSETSE>`, :ref:`NP <NP>`, :ref:`DTDP <DTDP>`\*:ref:`NSPOOLGE <NSPOOLGE>`, :ref:`NSPOOLGE <NSPOOLGE>`, :ref:`IRTYPE <IRTYPE>`
   :ref:`TIME <TIME>`, :ref:`IT <IT>`
   for k=1, :ref:`NP <NP>`
      k, :ref:`ETA2(k) <ETA2>`
   end k loop

   Repeat the block above for each time step until the end of the simulation.

Notes
-----

* Output may be in ascii or binary format depending on how :ref:`NOUTGE <NOUTGE>` is set in the :doc:`Model Parameter and Periodic Boundary Condition File <../input_files/fort15>`
* If binary output is specified, the node number (k) is not included in the output
