Minpr.63: Minimum Barometric Pressure
=====================================

See :doc:`Maximum and Minimum Value Files <maxmin63>` for detailed documentation of the file format and structure.

This file records the minimum barometric pressure at each node throughout the simulation. The values represent the lowest atmospheric pressure experienced at each node during the model run, which is particularly important for tracking the intensity and path of tropical cyclones and other low-pressure weather systems.
