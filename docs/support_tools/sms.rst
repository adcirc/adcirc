SMS (Surface-water Modeling System)
===================================

SMS is a comprehensive commercial software package for building and simulating surface water models. Developed by Aquaveo, it provides a full range of tools for coastal and riverine modeling applications, allowing users to access a variety of surface-water modeling solutions for both coastal and riverine environments.

Features
--------

* **Flexible Modeling Approaches**: Build models using a conceptual approach with GIS objects or use powerful mesh and grid generation tools
* **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D environment with optimized OpenGL graphics for improved hardware rendering
* **Data Import**: Support for various formats including raster images, elevation data, ArcGIS files, CAD files, web data services, and more
* **Advanced Modeling**: Interfaces with a wide range of numerical models for riverine analysis, contaminant transport, sediment transport, rural & urban flooding, coastal circulation, and inlet & wave modeling
* **Mesh & Grid Tools**: Powerful tools for building and managing computational meshes and grids
* **Animation & Rendering**: Create photo-realistic renderings and animations for presentations
* **Projection Support**: Worldwide projection support including Cartesian and Geographic systems
