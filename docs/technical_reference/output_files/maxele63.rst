Maxele.63: Maximum Water Surface Elevation
==========================================

See :doc:`Maximum and Minimum Value Files <maxmin63>` for detailed documentation of the file format and structure.

This file records the maximum water surface elevation at each node throughout the simulation. The values represent the highest water level reached at each node during the model run, which is particularly useful for flood mapping and hazard assessment.
