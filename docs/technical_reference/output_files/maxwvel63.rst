Maxwvel.63: Maximum Wind Speed
==============================

See :doc:`Maximum and Minimum Value Files <maxmin63>` for detailed documentation of the file format and structure.

This file records the maximum wind speed magnitude at each node throughout the simulation. The values represent the highest wind speeds experienced at each node during the model run, which is crucial for understanding the wind forcing conditions and their potential impacts on storm surge and wave generation.
