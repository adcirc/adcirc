Theory and Formulation
======================

This section presents the theoretical foundation and mathematical formulation of the ADCIRC (ADvanced CIRCulation) model. The content is based on the `ADCIRC theory document (2004) <https://adcirc.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2255/2018/11/adcirc_theory_2004_12_08.pdf>`_ and other publications.
