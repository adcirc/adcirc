ADCIRCpy
========

ADCIRCpy is a Python library for working with the ADCIRC coastal circulation and storm surge model. It provides automation tools for creating, configuring, and managing ADCIRC model simulations. Maintained by the Coastal Marine Modeling Branch (CMMB) of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey, it enables programmatic model setup, execution, and result processing.

Features
--------

* **Automated Model Setup**: Create and configure ADCIRC models through Python code
* **Input File Generation**: Automatically generate required ADCIRC input files
* **Forcing Management**: Set up and manage various forcings including tides, winds (BestTrack, ATMESH), and waves (WaveWatch3)
* **Job Submission Support**: Configure and run ADCIRC in parallel environments with support for job schedulers like Slurm
* **Mesh Handling**: Tools for working with ADCIRC meshes and their attributes
* **Customizable Outputs**: Specify various model outputs and sampling rates
* **Reproducible Workflows**: Create reproducible model configurations for multiple scenarios
