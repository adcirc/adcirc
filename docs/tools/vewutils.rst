VEW Utils
=========

VEW Utils is a Python and MATLAB package containing utilities for working with ADCIRC model files, post-processing results, and analyzing model outputs. It provides a collection of tools designed to simplify and enhance workflows for ADCIRC modelers, with specialized capabilities for generating and embedding channel meshes using Vertical Element Wall (VEW) techniques.

Features
--------

* **Channel Paving**: Tools for adding or editing 1D/2D channels in ADCIRC meshes using Vertical Element Wall (VEW) techniques
* **Mesh Management**: Tools for manipulating ADCIRC meshes, including merging multiple meshes with VEW support
* **DEM Processing**: Extract depths at nodes from Digital Elevation Models
* **Hydrology Boundary**: Generate flow boundary conditions from USGS stations or NOAA National Water Model data
* **Nodal Attributes**: Create nodal attribute values including Manning's n from landuse data
* **Visualization**: Tools for plotting ADCIRC simulation results and comparing with observations
* **Post-processing**: Analysis of simulation results including difference computation
* **VEW Processing**: Comprehensive tools for handling Vertical Element Wall features in ADCIRC meshes
