Open Boundaries
---------------

Open boundaries are boundaries where the water surface elevation is specified. Locations of the open boundaries are specified in :ref:`fort.14 <fort14>` file. For periodic conditions, the amplitudes, frequencies, and phases are defined in the :ref:`fort.15 <fort15>` file. For non-periodic conditions, time series of the water surface elevations are defined in the :ref:`fort.19 <fort19>` file.
