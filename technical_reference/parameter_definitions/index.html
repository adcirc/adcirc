This is applied by zeroing the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by zeroing the normal velocity in the momentum equations. This boundary condition should satisfy no normal flow in a global sense and no normal flow at each boundary node. This type of boundary represents a mainland boundary with a strong no normal flow condition and free tangential slip.</p>
<p>= 1 internal boundary with no normal flow treated as an essential boundary condition and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by zeroing the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by zeroing the normal velocity in the momentum equations. This boundary condition should satisfy no normal flow in a global sense and no normal flow at each boundary node. This type of boundary represents an island boundary with a strong normal flow condition and free tangential slip.</p>
<p>= 2 external boundary with non-zero normal flow as an essential boundary condition and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by specifying the non-zero contribution to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by specifying the non-zero normal velocity in the momentum equations. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense and the normal flux at each boundary node. This type of boundary represents a river inflow or open ocean boundary with a strong specified normal flow condition and free tangential slip. Discharges are specified either in the Model Parameter and Periodic Boundary Condition File for harmonic discharge forcing or in the Non-periodic, Normal Flux Boundary Condition File for time series discharge forcing.</p>
<p>= 3 external barrier boundary with either zero or non-zero normal outflow from the domain as an essential boundary condition and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by specifying the contribution (zero or non-zero) to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by specifying the (zero or non-zero) normal velocity in the momentum equations. Non-zero normal flow is computed using a supercritical, free surface weir formula if the barrier is overtopped. Zero normal flow is assumed if the barrier is not overtopped. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense and the normal flux at each boundary node. This type of boundary represents a mainland boundary comprised of a dike or levee with strong specified normal flow condition and free tangential slip. See External Barrier Boundary Note below for further information on exterior barrier boundaries.</p>
<p>= 4 internal barrier boundary with either zero or non-zero normal flow across the barrier as an essential boundary condition and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by specifying the contribution (zero or non-zero) to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by specifying the normal velocity (zero or non-zero) in the momentum equations. Non-zero normal flow is compute using either subcritical or supercritical, free surface weir formula (based on the water level on both sides of the barrier) if the barrier is overtopped. Zero normal flow is assumed if the barrier is not overtopped. This type of boundary represents a dike or levee that lies inside the computational domain with a strong specified normal flow condition and free tangential slip. See Internal Barrier Boundary Note for further information on exterior barrier boundaries.</p>
<p>= 5 internal barrier boundary with additional cross barrier pipes located under the crown. Cross barrier flow is treated as an essential normal flow boundary condition which leaves/enters the domain on one side of the barrier and enters/leaves the domain on the corresponding opposite side of the barrier flow rate and direction are based on barrier height, surface water elevation on both sides of the barrier, barrier coefficient and the appropriate barrier flow formula. In addition cross barrier pipe flow rate and direction are based on pipe crown height, surface water elevation on both sides of the barrier, pipe friction coefficient, pipe diameter and the appropriate pipe flow formula. Free tangential slip is allowed</p>
<p>= 10 external boundary with no normal and no tangential flow as essential boundary conditions. This is applied by zeroing the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by setting the velocity = 0 rather than solving momentum equations along the boundary. This boundary condition should satisfy no normal flow in a global sense and zero velocity at each boundary node. This type of boundary represents a mainland boundary with strong no normal flow and no tangential slip conditions.</p>
<p>= 11 internal boundary with no normal and no tangential flow as essential boundary conditions. This is applied by zeroing the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by setting the velocity = 0 rather than solving momentum equations along the boundary.

This type of boundary represents an island boundary with strong no normal flow and no tangential slip conditions.</p>
<p>= 12 external boundary with non-zero normal and zero tangential flow as an essential boundary condition. This is applied by specifying the non-zero contribution to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by setting the non-zero normal velocity and zero tangential velocity rather than solving momentum equations along the boundary. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense and the specified normal/zero tangential velocity at each boundary node. This type of boundary represents a river inflow or open ocean boundary in which strong normal flow is specified with no tangential slip. Discharges are specified either in the Model Parameter and Periodic Boundary Condition File for harmonic forcing or in the Non-periodic, Normal Flux Boundary Condition File for time series forcing.</p>
<p>= 13 external barrier boundary with either zero or non-zero normal outflow from the domain and zero tangential flow as essential boundary conditions. This is applied by specifying the contribution (zero or non-zero) to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation and by setting the (zero or non-zero) normal velocity and zero tangential velocity rather than solving momentum equations along the boundary. Non-zero normal flow is computed using a supercritical, free surface weir formula if the barrier is overtopped. Zero normal flow is assumed if the barrier is not overtopped. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense and the normal velocity/zero tangential velocity at each boundary node. This type of boundary represents a mainland boundary comprised of a dike or levee with strong specified normal flow and no tangential slip conditions. See External Barrier Boundary Note below for further information on exterior barrier boundaries.</p>
<p>= 20 external boundary with no normal flow as a natural boundary condition and no constraint on tangential flow. This is applied by zeroing the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation. There is no constraint on velocity (normal or tangential) applied in the momentum equations. This boundary condition should satisfy no normal flow in a global sense, but will only satisfy no normal flow at each boundary node in the limit of infinite resolution. This type of boundary represents a mainland boundary with a weak no normal flow condition and free tangential slip.</p>
<p>= 21 internal boundary with no normal flow as a natural boundary condition and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by zeroing the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation. There is no constraint on velocity (normal or tangential) in the momentum equations. This boundary condition should satisfy no normal flow in a global sense but will only satisfy no normal flow at each boundary node in the limit of infinite resolution. This type of boundary represents an island boundary with a weak no normal flow condition and free tangential slip.</p>
<p>= 22 external boundary with non-zero normal flow as a natural boundary condition and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by specifying the non-zero contribution to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation. There is no constraint on velocity (normal or tangential) in the momentum equations. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense but will only satisfy the normal flow at each boundary node in the limit of infinite resolution. This type of boundary represents a river inflow or open ocean boundary with a weak specified normal flow condition and free tangential slip. Discharges are specified either in the Model Parameter and Periodic Boundary Condition File for harmonic discharge forcing or in the Non-periodic, Normal Flux Boundary Condition File for time series discharge forcing.</p>
<p>= 23 external barrier boundary with either zero or non-zero normal outflow from the domain as a natural boundary condition and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by specifying the contribution (zero or non-zero) to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation. There is no constraint on velocity (normal or tangential) in the momentum equations. Non-zero normal flow is computed using a supercritical, free surface weir formula if the barrier is overtopped. Zero normal flow is assumed if the barrier is not overtopped. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense but will only satisfy the normal flow at each boundary node in the limit of infinite resolution. This type of boundary represents a mainland boundary comprised of a dike or levee with a weak specified normal flow condition and free tangential slip. See External Barrier Boundary Note below for further information on exterior barrier boundaries.</p>
<p>= 24 internal barrier boundary with either zero or non-zero normal flow across the barrier as a natural boundary condition and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by specifying the contribution (zero or non-zero) to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation. There is no constraint on velocity (normal or tangential) in the momentum equations. Non-zero normal flow is compute using either subcritical or supercritical, free surface weir formula (based on the water level on both sides of the barrier) if the barrier is overtopped. Zero normal flow is assumed if the barrier is not overtopped. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense but will only satisfy the normal flow at each boundary node in the limit of infinite resolution. This type of boundary represents a dike or levee that lies inside the computational domain with a weak specified normal flow condition and free tangential slip. See Internal Barrier Boundary Note below for further information on exterior barrier boundaries.</p>
<p>= 25 internal barrier boundary with additional cross barrier pipes located under the crown. Cross barrier flow is treated as a natural normal flow boundary condition which leaves/enters the domain on one side of the barrier and enters/leaves the domain on the corresponding opposite side of the barrier. Flow rate and direction are based on barrier height, surface water elevation on both sides of the barrier, barrier coefficient and the appropriate barrier flow formula. In addition cross barrier pipe flow rate and direction are based on pipe crown height, surface water elevation on both sides of the barrier, pipe friction coefficient, pipe diameter and the appropriate pipe flow formula. Free tangential slip is allowed.</p>
<p>= 30 wave radiation normal to the boundary as a natural boundary condition. This is applied by specifying the contribution to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation. There is no constraint on velocity (normal or tangential) in the momentum equations. The normal flow is computed using a Sommerfield radiation condition. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense but will only satisfy the normal flow at each boundary node in the limit of infinite resolution. This type of boundary represents an open boundary where waves are allowed to propagate freely out of the domain.</p>
<p>= 32 a combined specified normal flux and outward radiating boundary. The GWCE is forced with the total normal flux computed by adding the specified normal flux and the flux associated with the outward radiating wave. The latter is determine from a Sommerfeld type condition, flux=celerity*wave elevation. The momentum equations are used to compute the velocity field the same as for a nonboundary node.</p>
<p>= 40 a zero normal velocity gradient boundary. The GWCE is forced with normal flux, the momentum eqs are sacrificed in favor of setting the velocity at a boundary node equal to the value at a fictitious point inside the domain. The fictitious point lies on the inward directed normal to the boundary a distance equal to the distance from the boundary node to its farthest ‘neighbor. This should ensure that the fictitious point does not fall into an element that contains the boundary node. The velocity at the fictitious point is determined by interpolation.</p>
<p>= 41 a zero normal velocity gradient boundary. The GWCE is forced with normal flux. The momentum eqs are sacrificed in favor of eqs that set the velocity gradient normal to the boundary equal to zero in the Galerkin sense.</p>
<p>= 52 external boundary with periodic non-zero normal flow combined with wave radiation normal to the boundary as natural boundary conditions and no constraint on the tangential flow. This is applied by specifying the non-zero contribution to the normal boundary flux integral in the continuity equation. There is no constraint on velocity (normal or tangential) in the momentum equations. This boundary condition should correctly satisfy the flux balance in a global sense but will only satisfy the normal flow at each boundary node in the limit of infinite resolution. This type of boundary represents a periodic river inflow or open ocean boundary with a weak specified normal flow condition and free tangential slip where waves are allowed to propagate freely out of the domain. Discharges are specified in the Model Parameter and Periodic Boundary Condition File as harmonic discharge forcing. Additional parameters, including DRampExtFlux and FluxSettlingTime must also be set in the Model Parameter and Periodic Boundary Condition File in order to use this boundary type.</p>
<p>= 64 vertical element wall boundary that allows the mesh to have two nodes at the same horizontal location with different depths and allows water to seemlessly flow over the boundary, by primarily consolidating the nodal equations and occasionally using the weir formula. This boundary type is useful to have steep-sided channels or other vertical features represented in the mesh while, unlike barrier boundaries that entirely depend on the weir formula, solutions along this boundary are primarily computed based on the governing equations. See <a class="reference internal" href="../../user_guide/special_features/vertical_element_walls.html"><span class="doc">Vertical Element Walls (VEWs)</span></a> for more information.</p>
<p>= 102, 112, or 122 flux specified baroclinic. In order to designate a river boundary as baroclinic, 100 should be added to the IBTYPE that would be appropriate in the barotropic case. For example, to convert a barotropic river boundary (IBTYPE of 22) to a baroclinic river boundary with freshwater inflow, change the IBTYPE to 122. If there is a 1 in the 100s place of the IBTYPE, ADCIRC will then try to read an input file (fort.39) for the salinity and/or temperature boundary condition. The format of the fort.39 file depends on the value of IDEN; see the documentation of the fort.39 file for more details.</p>

<p>= 0, inconsistent input parameters will cause program termination.</p>
<p>= 1, inconsistent input parameters will, (when possible), be automatically corrected to a default or consistent value and execution continued. Be sure to read the nonfatal warning messages to see whether any parameters have been modified. Note that not all inconsistent parameters can be corrected automatically and therefore fatal error messages and program termination may still result.</p>
<p>Note for NFOVER:</p>
<p>Occasionally, the elevation solution becomes unphysically large due to improper numerical parameter settings, time step stability criteria violation. It can be useful for ADCIRC to terminate based on a user-specific limit to the computed water elevation. To enable this feature, ADCIRC must be compiled with the DEBUG_WARN_ELEV compiler directive. This is set in the cmplrflags.mk file. For example, for the serial model,</p>
<p>DA := -DREAL8 -DLINUX -DCSCA –DDEBUG_WARN_ELEV</p>
<p>and for the parallel model:</p>
<p>DP := -DREAL8 -DLINUX -DCSCA -DCMPI -DDEBUG_WARN_ELEV</p>
<p>This enables extra parameters in the fort.15 file, specified on the NFOVER line:</p>
<p>NFOVER, WarnElev, iWarnElevDump, WarnElevDumpLimit, ErrorElev</p>
<p>ADCIRC then monitors the maximum water elevation and behaves as follows:</p>
<p>A warning is issued if the elevation exceeds WarnElev.</p>
<p>A global elevation file (written to fort.69) will be written if WarnElev is exceeded AND iWarnElevDump == 1</p>
<p>Execution will be terminated if WarnElevDumpLimit global elevation files have been written due to the above warning limits.</p>
<p>Execution will be terminated if elevation exceeds ErrorElev.</p>
<p>The default values are:</p>
<p>WarnElev = 20.0 ! Warn at 20 meters</p>
<p>iWarnElevDump = 0 ! Do not write global elevation files</p>
<p>WarnElevDumpLimit = 50 ! Terminate execution if the warning level is reached 50 times</p>
<p>ErrorElev = 1000.0 ! Terminate execution of the water elevation exceeds 1000 meters</p>
<p>Example: to override the defaults, recompile ADCIRC as above, and modify the NFOVER line in the fort.15 file:</p>
<p>1 10. 0 100 30.</p>
<p>This will cause ADCIRC to warn when the water elevation exceeds 10 meters, no global elevation files will be written, and ADCIRC will terminate if 100 warnings are generated OR the elevation exceeds 30 meters.</p>

A good rule of thumb for setting TAU0 is to set it equal to the largest value of an equivalent linear friction factor (e.g, for linear friction TAU0 = TAU; for quadratic friction TAU0 = maximum (speed*CF/depth). Typical values for TAU0 are in the range of 0.005 – 0.1.</p>

The datetime tells ADCIRC what time corresponds to t=0. For example, if the datetime is specified as 2005 08 29 06 on a cold start, then ADCIRC will find that time in the Single File Meteorological Forcing Input File, linearly interpolating if necessary, to get its initial wind state. For a hotstart, the time in the hotstart file will be added to this datetime before seeking the proper place in the Single File Meteorological Forcing Input File. For example, if the coldstart datetime is still specified as 2005 08 29 06, and the time in the hotstart file is 86400 seconds, ADCIRC will start up and interpolate in the Single File Meteorological Forcing Input File for the conditions at 6:00 am on August 30, 2005 to get its hotstart wind state. One limitation is that an ADCIRC run cannot cross the boundary of the calendar year, i.e. start in December and end in January. StormNumber is an integer and should be set to 1. BLAdj is the adjustment factor between wind speed at 10m and the wind speed at the top of the atmospheric boundary layer (winds at top of atm. b.l.)=(winds at 10m)/BLAdj.

Spatially varying quadratic friction coefficients, Manning’s n or Chezy coefficients may be specified using nodal attributes in the fort.13 file, (see the NWP section). In these cases the friction coefficient values specified in the nodal attribute file are converted to equivalent FFACTOR values at each node in the domain and at every timestep (e.g., see the documentation on the Manning’s n nodal attribute for the formula used to convert Manning’s n to an equivalent quadratic friction coefficient). If a Manning’s n formulation is specified using nodal attributes, then CF is read in and used as the minimum equivalent quadratic friction coefficient (i.e., FFACTOR minimum = CF). If another bottom friction factor is specified via nodal attributes, CF is read in but ignored.</p>
<p>If NOLIBF = 2, the hybrid bottom friction formulation is used FFACTOR = CF*[1+(HBREAK/H)**FTHETA]**(FGAMMA/FTHETA and CF is as specified in this expression.

This comparison is helpful for identifying numerical instabilities and for determining how complete the harmonic analysis was. Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>FMV = 0. Do not compute any means and vars.</p>
<p>FMV = 0.1 Compute means and vars. over final 10% of period used in harmonic analysis</p>
<p>FMV = 1.0 Compute means and vars. over entire period used in harmonic analysis</p>
<p>Note: the means and variance calculations are only done if global harmonic calculations are performed. Results are written out to fort.55. A summary of the poorest comparisons throughout the domain and the node numbers where these occurred is given at the end of the fort.16 output file.</p>
<p>Note: the time series resysthesis from the harmonic constituents can use up a lot of CPU time since this is done for every time step during the specified part of the harmonic analysis period. If the harmonic analysis period extends for only a few days, it is practical to set FMV=1. Otherwise, it becomes unreasonably time consuming to compute means and variances for more than 10-20 days. Ultimately, the practical limit to these calculations depends on the number of nodes, the number of constituents in the harmonic analysis, and the size of the time step.</p>

Alternatively, for tropical cyclones, setting the ‘DragLawString’ equal to “Powell” causes a more complex formulation to be used, where different formulas apply to different storm quadrants. If ice coverage data have been specified via appropriate specification of the NWS parameter, the wind drag coefficient formulation can also be set to IceCube (the default) or RaysIce.
