Instructions for complete installation of SWAN
----------------------------------------------

Installation of SWAN can be done by means of the make and perl
utilities. Please carry out the following tasks:

   1) Ensure that the Perl package is available on your computer.
      Check it by typing 'perl -v'. The Perl version should be at
      least 5.0.0 or higher.

   2) Type 'make config' or 'nmake config' (in case of MS Windows)
      to create configuration file. This file (macros.inc) contains
      machine-dependent macros to be needed by the Makefile.

   3) Compilation of the SWAN source code for sequential runs can
      be done by typing 'make ser' or 'nmake ser' (in case of
      MS Windows). For parallel runs, however, the user may
      choose between linking the MPI libraries for distributed
      memory machines and using OpenMP directives for shared memory
      systems for appropriate compilation by typing, respectively,
      'make mpi' and 'make omp'. However, for parallel, unstructured
      mesh simulation on a distributed memory system, type 'make punswan'.
      NOTE: One of these commands must be preceded once by 'make config'.

   4) For more information, please consult the Implementation Manual.
