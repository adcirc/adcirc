GCTPC is a software library for geolocation written by the USGS

gctpc adds:
           (1) support for ellipsoidal models of the earth 
           (2) support for new projections
           (3) transformations:  (lat,lon) -> (X, Y)
                                 (X, Y) -> (lat, lon)

           (1) is necessary as grid approach 1 km.
           (3) is necessary if you want to replace the grib1-centric IPOLATES library
                (limited to spherical earth, 0.001 degrees lat/lon precision)
