Intel ICC:                                                      updated 2/2017

prior to wgrib2 v2.0.6

   The makefile doesn't compile Jasper 1.900.1 "correctly".  Testing 
   fails with writing of jpeg2000 encoded files.  The portland
   C compiler fails with the exact same symptoms.  May be
   a Jasper source code problem rather than a compiler problem.

   Compiling by icc is not supported and was turned off in the makefile


wgrib2 v2.0.6

   Icc still doesn't compile Jasper 1.900.1 "correctly".  However,
in order to get the wgrib2 ftn api accepted, it will have to support
the intel fortran compiler.  So the makefile was changed so that
all the C code is compiled with icc except for Jasper which is
compiled with gcc.  It works.  It will probably fail if one of
the compilers is old.

Bash:

   export CC=icc
   export FC=ifort
   export COMP_SYS=intel_linux                 for linux only
   make                                        makes wgrib2/wgrib2
   make lib                                    makes lib/*.a lib/*.mod for wgrib2api


            WARNING WARNING - Compiling wgrib2 on WINDOWS


Wgrib2 follows the standards (no Microsoft Visual C is not a standard).  Wgrib2
uses fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence) for random access.  Most 64-bit
systems define long to be a 64 bit integer.  As a result,  wgrib2 on will support 
large files.  

Unfortunately long is usually defined as 32-bits on 64-bit Windows compilers including the 
windows version of icc.  This is entirely appropriate as "640K ought to be enough for anybody".  
Icc/windows defines long to be 32 bits long, and wgrib2 compiled with icc is limited to 2GB 
files.  You could use fseeko(FILE *stream, off_t offset, int whence) to access large files.  
Unfortunately this comforms to standards SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001 which are not usually supported 
by Windows C compilers.  (I could find no suggestion that it was supported by icc/windows.)
For Windows, I suggest that you use the 64-bit Cgywin gcc/gfortran compilers.  They are the 
exception and define longs to be 64 bit on Windows.
