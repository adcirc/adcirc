                 IPOLATES: grid interpolation library   8/2018

IPOLATES is a fortran library from NCEP that interpolates between 
grids using both scalar and vector interpolates.  IPOLATES knows 
about grid-relative winds and can convert those winds to earth-relative
winds and vice versa.  IPOLATES included with wgrib2 supports

   bilinear
   bicubic
   nearest neighbor
   budget

interpolation.  The interpolation routines are aware of and uses 
the flag for undefined values.  As of writing (8/2018), the single
precision GRIB1 version of ipolates is being replaced by the
double precision GRIB2 version of ipolates.. (wgrib2 v2.0.7 uses
the former and v2.0.8 will use the latter.)

Installing the IPOLATE enables the following functions to work

	-new_grid                  interpolate to a new grid

	-new_grid_winds            set type of winds to use (mandatory)

	-new_grid_vectors          set type of vector fields

	-new_grid_interpolation    set type of interpolation to use
					bilinear is the default

	-new_grid_ipopt            set interpolation parameters
				   see iplib documentation

       The single-precision GRIB1 ipolates is used in operations at NCEP.
       The double-precision GRIB2 ipolates is formally in beta testing at NCEP.

           ipolates was written by staff at NCEP and is in the public domain


                  IPOLATES and wgrib2: the good

With the IPOLATES library, wgrib2 can interpolate from one grib file 
to another grib file.  You can also convert from grid-relative to 
more commonly used earth-relative winds.

            Single precision GRIB1 IPOLATES: the bad

This version of IPOLATES is a single precision library.  It assumes a
spherical earth, The grib1 standard uses a position to the nearest
millidegreee except the single precsion math puts the practical
precision to about a hundredth of a degree using IEEE floats.

The ipoltes library assumes a hard-coded radius of spherical earth.  Wgrib2
works around the problem and supports a variable radius spherical grid by
assuming the radius is the mean of the semi-major and semi-minor axes.

"Glahn" scanning mode is not supported.


            Double precision GRIB2 IPOLATES: the good

This library supports lat-lon values to the grib2 standard of a 
millidegree.  The WMO standard rotated lat-lon grids are supported, and
we are working towards supporting the FV3 cubed sphere.

Double precision should be slower than single precision. However, more threaded
code has made the performance on multi-core machines similar or much better
(budget interpolation).

Future versions of this library will support the "Glahn" scanning order
and perhaps the staggering bits.

            Double precision GRIB2 IPOLATES: the bad

This library is restricted to a spherical earth.

Wgrib2 is probably the first major use of this library.


                 Changes

2/2012   changed to new IPOLATES
3/2013:  removed OpenMP directives
7/2016:  tested iplib.v3.0.0 (current version at NCEP)
         internal interface uses optional arguments, faster because 
            unnecessary calculations are avoided
         passes testing, if passes more testing, will replace iplib.2012
9/2017   iplib.v3.0.0 is default, tested in NCO Operations
	 (this wasn't my idea)

5/2018   option to use grib2 ipolates
7/2018   finished optimization of grib2 ipolates so that I expect that
         time critical codes will not be affected by the new library.
