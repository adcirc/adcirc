How do I compile on NCEP's Cray

export CC=/opt/gcc/4.4.4/gcc

make 

You can compile with intel compilers by

export CC=icc
export FC=ifort
export COMP_SYS=intel_linux
make 

but the executable will not run unless the intel environment is loaded
because of missing libraries.

You can compile with newer GNU compilers by

export CC=gcc
export FC=gfortran
make 

but the executable will not run unless the gnu environment is loaded
because of missing libraries.

You may be able to modify the makefile to statically link in the necessary
(static) libraries if available.
