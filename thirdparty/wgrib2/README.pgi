PGI: pgcc

Preliminary testing using pgcc 11-10.0

The makefile doesn't compile Jasper "correctly".  Testing 
fails with writing of jpeg2000 encoded files.  The Intel
C compiler fails with the exact same symtoms.  May be
a Jasper source code problem rather than a compiler problem.

Compiling by pgcc was turned off in the makefile
