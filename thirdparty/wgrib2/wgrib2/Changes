		    downstream software.
		changed -prob: prob>N to prob >N, prob<N prob <N, prob>N <N to prob =N
		-lev0 .. handle factions of a PV unit in control file

		fix -udf_arg buf[2]
		   want all calls to f_*() to use call_ARGN(buffer, NULL, arg1..argN)
		   if (local == NULL) then call is recursive. must examine code to check local not used!              
		all code: CALL_ARG{N} -> call_ARG{N}
		netcdf/mysql*.c:  f_lev(...) -> f_lev(call_ARG0)
		wgrib2: f_match_inv(..) -> f_match_inv(call_ARG0) f_help -> f_help(call_ARG0)
		added -set table_4.3
		added -Werror=format-security to makefile by suggestion of Orion Poplawski
		modified   sprintf(inv_out, string) to sprintf(inv_out,"%s", string) by Orion Poplawski

		Earth.c  added code table 9. set_radius now handles user defined radius, major minor axes
		int8.c best_scaled_value() uses maximum scaled value < INT_MAX
		Netcdf.c  Fixed latlon grid longitudes.  COARDS wants longitude to be
		   monotonic and left longitude can be any value. However, Some codes will not
		   will not handle a left longitude of 180.5 but will work with -175.5.
		   So left longitude is set to [-180,180) and longitudes are monotonic.
		   Problem found by K. Havener who also did the testing.

		added support for staggered grids
		added set_ival
		updated set_ival to support a list of pointsZ
		complex_pk.c free(u) early, reduce footprint by 4*ndata bytes
		int8.c best_scaled_value() increases scaling (giving more precision) as long as 
                   val-floor(val) != 0 and val/10 < INT_MAX, this means val=1000 is kept as 1000.
		   NOTE: the scaling factor and scaled value changes from previous versions of wgrib2
		   NOTE: the scaled level1 and level2 have changed .. more precision
		gribtable: two SOILM with two different units kg/m/m and kg/m/m/m, both are deprecated
		   rename SOILM (kg/m/m/m) to SOIL_M, so grib1 and grib2 tables are the same
		   it is a deviation from NCO tables but NCO hasn't made a decision
		   NOTE: SOIL_M is not in NCO tables

		added -import_grib
		-fcst_ave, -ave, -wind_dir, -wind_speed, -merge, -ncep_norm : old: picked

			convert to data to integer vector  u[i] = floor((data[i] - ref)*scale + 0.5);
			when using decimal scaling, ref is not quite the min value under all compilation
			options (could be 64-bit register vs 32-bit memory value).  The scaling factor is 
			so large that u[i] could be negative!  Added a step to make sure u[i] is >= 0

		fixed makefile: added mkdir include
		space_view.c space_view2ll() Leon Majewski found that lop was incorrectly defined.
		   lop = int4(sec[3]+38); -> lop = int4(sec[3]+42); Not noticed because EUMET

		wgrib2(): if malloc of data fails && callable wgrib2 .. set ndata = 0
		EOF.c: many small changes
		wgrib2: fixed setjmp code .. must save current stack frame!!!! else seg fault

		changed gctpc to remove warning about som_series by removing static som_series from proj.h
		   and adding them to sominv.c and somfor.c
		Mem_buffer: data structures are statically initialized here instead of call to 
		    init_mem_buffers, this allows external routines to initialize memory file.for CW2
		init_mem_buffers only checks that initialization was done
		RPN.c initialize rpn_n[] and rpn_data[] at compile time rather than at run time
		    allows external routines to initialize RPN registers

		ieee_pk.c simple_pk.c Small_grib.c remove #include <jasper/jasper.h>
		added dec_png_clone.c changes to makefile and unpk.c: Need to make
			wgrib2 totally independent of g2clib in default mode.
			Problem was NCEP Central Operations (NCO) had g2clib compiled with
			-D __64BITS__ which told g2clib that ints were 64 bits even
			though ints were 32 bits!  Normal people don't do this.  
			So if you linked in NCO's libraries you had problems in the API.  
			However, NCO requires you to link in their libraries.  I have no idea
			how many external versions of g2clib this will affect as it is unknown
			if the NCO makefile for g2clib is widely distributed.

		bug fix: Many thanks to Steve Sullivan (mathcom.com) who found a bug in complex packing 
		    (complex_grib_out) and provided a bug fix.  Complex packing divides the string of grid 
		    points into groups.  The minimum grid point value within the group is the group reference
		    value.  In order to pack the group references, you need to find the maximum
		    group reference value (grefmx).  The loop that finds the grefmx bypasses the reference 
		    value of the 1st group.  This is a problem when the reference value of the 1st group is 
		    the maximum reference values and the number of bits required to encode this value is 
		    larger than number of bits required to encode the second largest reference value.  
		    This bug is for versions 2.0.0 - 2.0.3.  This bug is more likely to occur when the grid 
		    is small.

		withdrawn before 48 hours to allow changes to ftn_api
		The following changes are so that metadata returned from grb2_inq(..) is of the
		 format: D=YYYYMMDDHHmmss:var:lev:etc

		 The rest is so that index file is a superset of that format and
		 compatibility with the D= instead of d=

		set_metadata:  old str:  x:x:d=yyyymmddhh(mmss):etc
		               new str:  x:x:(d|D)=yyyymmddhh(mmss):etc
		grb2_inq(..,desc=str,.. old: str=`wgrib2 -s`    ie d=YYYYMMDDHH:var:lev:,etc
 		                        new: str=`wgrib2 -S`    ie D=YYYYMMDDHHmmss:var:lev:etc
		grb2_mk_inv: old wgrib2 GRB -match_inv > INV

		CodeTable. 4.6: pdt 40 and 42 identified as ensemble
		-set_num_ens: works with any PDT with code table 4.6
		error if g2clib == 1 and decoding png field
		   decoding png is ok
		   decimal scaling is set to decimal scale of last constant field or 0.
                   This causes an error in -grib (BAD) or using the input scaling parameters (Not Great)
                   The BAD effects are rare because pngs are rare and people rarely decode and do -grib at the same time
                   The Not Great problems are only rare vs rare**2.  This involves a change a precision
                   which could results in a loss of precision.
		-set_grib_type now understands complex1-bitmap (c1b), complex2-bitmap (c2b), complex3-bitmap (c3b)
		-mysql_speed: size of character strings for table data changed from 1500 to MAX_SQL_INSERT=3000
                    user added an additional variable to a 40-level GFS output and wgrib2 crashed.

		grb_inq(..): read of ftn_api_fn0 changed from i8,5(1x,i8) to i11,5(1x,i11)
		    this allows reading of grids bigger than 99,999,999 points
		-v -varX : the output has been reformatted for local variables have the format
                          var discipline=0 center=34 local_table=1 parmcat=1 parm=203 
		-set_var(..) now understands: -var (undefined variables) and -varX formats
                   var discipline=0 center=34 local_table=1 parmcat=1 parm=203 
                   var discipline=10 master_table=2 parmcat=0 parm=11

		-set_pdt: supports  minutes_of_observational_data_cutoff_after_reference_time
		-set_pdt: supports model version date pdt 60, 61
		-f_Match_inv, f_match_inv, replace CALL_ARG0 by call_ARG0 (modern)
		Set_metadata.c replace CALL_ARG0 by call_ARG1 (modern)
		f_(set|get)_(byte|hex|int|int2|ieee): Boi used octet == 0, so I added error checking
			for octet <= 0, slightly changed error message for out of bounds section
		Config.c:  make #include <jasper/jasper.h> conditionally compiled

		Ftime2: defined left and right in in unsupported cases
		received space view perspective grid with a satellite not on 0N OE but 0N 41.5E
                     which exposed some problems.
		   space_view.c: remove conversion of lop to radians

		added: -reduced_gaussian_grid, transform from reduced Gaussian to full Gaussian grids
v0.2.0.7   12/2017 -----------------------------------
		report that missing. zlib.h in RedHat system, changed makefile which may 
                   but probably doesn't fix the problem
		update Code_Values.c
		Time_processing.c: do_ave .. quit if save->n_fields == 0
		added -ens_processing
		Level.c update code table 4.5 (level_table[]), replace CodeTable_4.5_ncep.dat 
		    by ncep_level_table[] (needed by -set_lev) and makes codes more consistent
                    eliminated need for CodeTable_4.5_ncep.dat and get_code_Table_4.5_ncep.sh
		    simplified special ncep levels
		-set_lev: fixed lowest level 11% integrated cloud cover
		-set_lev: added (level1) - (level2)
		ftn_wgrib2api: added grb2_UNDEFINED, grb2_DEFINED_VAL(), grb2_UNDEFINED_VAL()
		-set_lev: added %g in sequence (ncep level 241)
		net result: inventory levels is updated, -set_lev handles more levels
		makefile: gfort, icc, ifort more info in -config
		wgrib2(argc, const char **argv) => wgrib2(argc, char **argv)
		added -box_ave
		ncep grid 184 added: C. McGill
		grb2_inq(): bufer size was 53 instead of 71.
		move -fi from Match.c -> Fi.c
		move -end from Match.c -> End.c
		wgrib2api: grb2_inv: grid/desc, -last -> -last0
		   no affect on good code, less space used code with non-unique matches
		prob: added fcst number/total
                   prob >2.54 -> prob >2.54:prob fcst 255/255
		wgrib2_get_mem_buffer_size(int n): return 0 instead of -1
		     size_t is unsigned
		bug in sub_dt(..): if subtract time, and result should be dec 31
		    bug:  dtime > jday -> dtime >= jday
		    bug affects: -set_date when using -set_date -Xhr
			and the reference date should be dec 31.
		    bug affects: verfification time when using negative forecast time (rare) and
			verification time should be Dec 31.
		wgrib2api.f90: changes len=100 to len=300 for longer file names
		USE_IPOLATES = 0,1,3 (new): changed makefile, Config.c ncep_grids.c mk_kgds.c New_grid.c
		-new_grid_winds: old-needed IPOLATES to be installed. new-IPOLATES does not need
			to be installed, needed for -submsg_uv
		wgrib2/makefile: removed references to NCEP_local_levels_test.h as no longer used
		added copy_dbl_data(..)  same as copy_data(..) except for double rather than float
		starting adding support for PDT 70 (post processing)
		sec3_grids.c sets wind rotation to earth
		modified -match_inv_add to use 2 arguments to the option
		added diagnostics to -merge_fcst: same_sec4_for_merge(.) when fails to merge
		fixed -set_radius 3:major_km:minor_km
		-set data_* and -set data_+ added
		closest(..): 2G+, some openmp speedup
		removed OpenMP from  gctpc_ll2xy.  gctpc_ll2i
		rot_regular2ll (returns lat-lon of rotated lat-lon grid) OpenMP enabled.
		fixed Warn_old_g2lib.c, HEADER swapped 0:inv (from Dusan Jovic)
		rm jasper-1.900.1 jasper-1.900.1.orig from jasper-1.900.1-14ubuntu3.2.debian.tgz (from Dusan Jovic)
		fix rpn smth9r
		makefile: rm tmpz.tar, ${cwd}/share, ${cwd}/tmp (from Dusan Jovic)
		Manfred Schwarb made his usual no-changes-needed contribution.  He
                  fixed and updated get_gribtab.sh which updates the gribtable.  Some
                  corrections and units are made more consistent. Thanks Manfred.
		-new_grid: correct file name in error message if could not open output file
		grb2_inq(..) fix error message if no message matches.
		-ens_processing: do all calcs from sorted data (speedup)
		Ensemble.c: added more statistics, set code_table 4.3
		updated code table table 4.3
		changed makefile: cd ${proj4} -> cd ${proj4dir}   thansk Simon Horton
		changed makefile to use latest netcdf4 and hdf5 v4.6.1 and 1.8.20
		   note: hdf5 v1.10 can read v1.8 but not vice versa. stupid.
		ftime2: change "ave(0 min fcst)" to "ave anl", like ftime1, set_ftime2 already works
		added to -set_lev "n-m hybrid layer", needed for fv3
		iplib2_d: change splat -> ip_splat
		wgrib2api: added get_(ref/start/end)_edate, dynamical allocation of @mem:XX
		change number of memory buffers to 30, should fix wgrib2api to read N_num_memory_buffers
		   from wgrib2.h file
		Level.c and Mod_grib.c added %g (Eta|logarithmic hybrid|hybrid height|hybrid pressure) 
                   level and layers, needed by fv3-core
		Grads.c: added hyp and hyh (hybrid pressure level/layer and hybrid height level/layer)
		changed Ftime2.c so that when NCEP prints TMIN/TMAX
                   old: 264:30420217:d=2004021912:TMIN:2 m above ground:66-72 hour missing fcst:
                   new: 264:30420217:d=2004021912:TMIN:2 m above ground:66-72 hour fcst:
                   the missing refers to a missing statistical operator (ex. ave, acc, min, max)
                   this verion is 1 hour newer than v0.1.7.8 .. for operations
		RPN.c: old: -rpn :asasdf was ignored, now a warning
		netcdf4 - change hdf5 1.8.18/1.8.18 to 1.10.4
		   problem with newer gcc (ubuntu) with v1.8.20, however, 1.10.x
		   may produce files that are not compatible with 1.8.
		Aerosol.c if (pdt < 44 && pdt > 48) -> if (pdt < 44 || pdt > 48) from Manfred Schwarb
		Time_processing.c duplicate  else if (pdt == 12) from Manfred Schwarb
		Reduced_gaussian.c removed extran extern output_order_type output_order; from Manfred Schwarb
		dec_png_clone.c void user_read_data_clone(.... png_uint_32) ->  void user_read_data_clone(... png_size_t)
			from Manfred Schwarb, worked on 32 bit machines because png_uint_32 == png_size_t
                        worked on X86_64 because X86_64 calling conventions transferred arg in a 64-bit
			register for both microsoft, linux and AIX(?) calling conventions
		makefile, config.h and Config.c: list version of hdf5
		11/2018 updated gribtab  manually changed CLWMR to CLMR
		Sec3.c added static print_stagger(), more grids with stagger
		-ens_processing: fixed bug in setting number of ens members
		-N_ens: fixed to print nothing if doesn't exist
		-import_text, open changed from r+ to r
		-import_ieee, -import_bin, open changed from rb+ to rb
		added const char *wgrib2api_info() .. library info
		makefile: compile netcdf4 without OpenMP
		fixed same_sec4_but_ensemble .. f1..f4 were off by 1, no affect on released codes fixed ens_processing
v0.2.0.8b9   12/2018 - never released v2.0.8
		-ens_processing: fixed spread calculation (one pass -> 2 pass calculation)
		-ndate, -ndates: added with mn (minutes) support
		-set_date, -time_processing: now supports mn time offsets
		added spectral option to -new_grid
		new_grid: removed loop to determine ibi
		-set_ftime2: works with pdt 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 41, 43
		-alarm will clear alarm in finalize stage
		init.c added include <string.h> in
