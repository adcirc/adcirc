                  wgrib2 *.c *.h *.sh and documentation


The components of wgrib2, the C/Fortran API and wgrib2 library are either in 
the public domain or covered by the GNU General Public License depending on 
the files in question.  No other licence will be accepted into this archive 
of wgrib2 modules.  (Already have too many licences for the libraries.)  Unlike
the situation with the libraries, it would be difficult to make a PD-only
version of wgrib2.

Distribution of wgrib2 needs to be compatible with all applicatable licences.
