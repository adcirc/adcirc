These flags have to be set in mode == -1 to get certain actions

decode = 1		decode grib grid point values and save to *data
         0  (default)

output_order_wanted = raw
                      wens  (default)
                      wesn


latlon = 1              calculate lat-lon of grid points and save to *lat , *lon
        -0  (default)

save_translation = 1    save the translation vector to go from input -> output scan order
                        translation vector is only good if output_order_wanted != raw
                            if (*translation == NULL) input_order == output_order_wanted
                   0  (default)
