	Using wgrib2 with Interactive programs
		Version 1.0

Introduction.

    With some jobs, you know what you want before hand.  In this
situation, one could run wgrib2 to decode the files and then run
another program to process the decoded data.  However, with interactive
programs, the flow is much different. You want to be able to control
the functions of wgrib2 on the fly.

Simple case: Decode a simple file

	(stdin) is from a named pipe
	(output) is to a named pipe

	program starts wgrib2 with the desired options and with the two pipe
	connections

	when the main program wants a record decoded, it send the inventory
	line to the (stdin) pipe.  Then it read the (output) pipe.

	ToDo: change code to read "stdin" from arbitrary files.  Add fflush to
	output files.

Simple cast + 1: Decode a "template" dataset

	Need to add a dataset name into the "stdin" stream.

Complicated: change options and datasets on the fly.



Neat things to consider:

	Batch processor for Nomads.  Don't want to "restart" wgrib2 all the
	time.

	OpenDAP server based on wgrib2.
