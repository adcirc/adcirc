                                           -new_grid


-new_grid option uses the NCEP iplib to do grid interpolation.  The iplib is
based on a grib1 API.

Problems:
	grib1 uses "single" precision for latitudes and longitudes
	iplib assumes a spherical earth.
	iplib uses a fixed radius (not apparent to wgrib2 users)
	iplib may have some problems with SH regional grids
	written in fortran

Pluses:
	supports NCEP model grids
	available
	many interpolation options

Customizations of iplib
	1) portability
	2) removed spectral interpolation
	3) removed neighbor budget interpolation

	2 and 3 were mainly done to deduce the code size


                                   Adding support for a new Grid
                                     already supported by iplib

1) new input grid

	Add grid to mk_kgds()  .. sec3 -> kgds

2) new output grid
	Modify New_grid.c: parse parameters describing new grid
			   call sec3_new_grid() to create a new sec3. 
				See sec3_grid.c
			   add grid to mk_kgds()
                           
	Note: adding a new output grid automatically adds it to an supported
	input grid.
