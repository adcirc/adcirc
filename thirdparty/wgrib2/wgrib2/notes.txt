Getting data from internet

   Look for scripts like code_table_0_0.sh

   They look at a URL (ncep web site)
   write out a data file/C code

   Some tables will be used as is.
   Some tables (written in *need_to_edit*) will have to be merged by hand
      (sorry) with the old table.  Reason: want to use abreviations and
      shorter description than used by the table.  Note: old entries
      should not change so not to break user code.
