<p>The Generalized Asymmetric Holland Model (hereinafter, GAHM) is a parametric
hurricane vortex model developed in ADCIRC for operational forecasting purpose,
based on the classic Holland Model  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id12" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> (hereinafter, HM). The original HM was
developed to render an ideal symmetric hurricane (a.k.a., annular hurricane). To
represent hurricanes that may exhibit asymmetric structures, the Asymmetric
Holland Model (hereinafter, AHM) was developed and implemented in ADCIRC for
more practical usages <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id13" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, which has the same set of equations as of the HM,
but takes azimuthally-varying radius to the maximum wind to reconstruct its
spatial pressure and wind fields. Both the HM and AHM suffer from flaws that
make rendering large but weak storms difficult. As a result, efforts were made
to develop a more generalized model to fulfill the purpose. Compared to the HM
and the AHM, the GAHM removes the assumption of cyclostrophic balance at the
radius of maximum wind during derivation of its equations, and allows for a
better representation of a wide range of hurricanes. Another important feature
of the GAHM is the introduction of a composite wind method, which when activated
enables the usage of multiple storm isotaches. It makes representing complex
hurricane structures possible.</p>
<section id="the-classic-holland-model">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>The Classic Holland Model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-classic-holland-model" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The HM is an analytic model that describes the radial pressure and wind profiles
of a standard hurricane. To begin with, Holland found that the normalized
pressure profiles of a number of hurricanes resemble a family of rectangular
hyperbolas and may be approximated by a hyperbolic equation, which after
antilogarithms and rearranging yields the radial pressure equation:</p>
<center><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(r) = P_c + (P_n - P_c)e^{-A/r^B} \quad\)</span> (1)</p>
</center><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_c\)</span> is the central pressure, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_c\)</span> is the ambient pressure
(theoretically at infinite radius), <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(r)\)</span> is the pressure at radius
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> from the center of the hurricane, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> are
shape parameters that may be empirically estimated from observations in a
hurricane.</p>
<p>Substituting (1) into the gradient wind equation, which describes a steady flow
balanced by the horizontal pressure gradient force, the centripetal
acceleration, and the Coriolis acceleration for a vortex above the influence of
the planetary boundary layer where the atmospheric flow decouples from surface
friction  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id14" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, gives the radial wind equation of a hurricane:</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V_g(r) = \sqrt{AB(P_n - P_c)e^{-A/r^B}/\rho r^B + (\frac{rf}{2})^2} - \frac{rf}{2} \quad (2)\]</div>
</center><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_g(r)\)</span> is the gradient wind at radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> is
the density of air, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is the Coriolis parameter. In the region of the
maximum winds, if we assume that the Coriolis force is negligible in comparison
to the pressure gradient and centripetal force, then the air is in cyclostrophic
balance. By removing the Coriolis term in (2) we get the cyclostrophic wind</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V_c(r) = \sqrt{AB(P_n - P_c)e^{-A/r^B}/\rho r^B} \quad (3)\]</div>
</center><p>By setting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dV_c/dr = 0\)</span> at radius to the maximum wind
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = R_{max}\)</span>, it is obtained that</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[A = (R_{max})^B \quad (4)\]</div>
</center><p>Thus the (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>) is irrelevant to the relative value of ambient and
central pressures, and is solely defined by the shape parameters <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. Substituting (4) back into (3) to get rid of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, we get an
estimate of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> as a function of the maximum wind speed</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[B = (V_{max})^2\rho e/(P_n - P_c) \quad (5)\]</div>
</center><p>It was notable that the maximum wind speed is proportional to the square root of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and irrespective of the (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>), given a constant pressure
drop. It was also reasoned by Holland that a plausible range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> would
be between 1 and 2.5 for realistic hurricanes. Substituting (4) and (5) back
into (1) and (2) yields the final radial pressure and wind profiles for the HM</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(r) = P_c + (P_n - P_c)e^{-(R_{max}/r)^B} \quad (6)\]</div>
</center><center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V_g(r) = \sqrt{(V_{max})^2e^{1-(R_{max}/r)^B}(R_{max}/r)^B + (\frac{rf}{2})^2} - \frac{rf}{2} \quad (7)\]</div>
</center><p>When sparse observations of a hurricane are given, estimates of the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> and shape parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> can be estimated by fitting data
into the radial wind equation, which in turn allow us to compute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(r)\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_g(r)\)</span> along the radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> of the hurricane. However,
discrepancies between wind observations and computed winds were sometimes found,
and were negatively correlated to the Rossby number at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = R_{max}\)</span>,
defined as</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[R_o = \frac{Nonlinear Acceleration}{Coriolis force} \approx \frac{V_{max}^2/R_{max}}{V_{max}f} = \frac{V_{max}}{R_{max}f} \quad (8)\]</div>
</center><p>By definition, a large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o (\approx 10^3)\)</span> describes a system in
cyclostrophic balance that is dominated by the inertial and centrifugal force
with negligible Coriolis force, such as a tornado or the inner core of an
intense hurricane, whereas a small value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\approx 10^{-2} \sim 10^2)\)</span>
signifies a system in geostrophic balance where the Coriolis force plays an
important role, such as the outer region of a hurricane. As a result, the
assumption of cyclostrophic balance at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> made in HM is mostly
valid for describing an intense and narrow (small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>) hurricane
with a large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span>, but not applicable for a weak and broad hurricane with
a small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span>. This intrinsic problem with the HM calls our intention to
develop a generalized model that will work consistently for a wide range of
hurricanes, which theoretically can be accomplished by removing the above
cyclostrophic balance assumption and re-derive the radial pressure and wind
equations (6)&amp;(7).</p>
</section>
<section id="derivation-of-the-gahm">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>Derivation of the GAHM<a class="headerlink" href="#derivation-of-the-gahm" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The GAHM also starts with the same radial pressure and wind equations (1)&amp;(2)
with shape parameters <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, as in the HM. Without assuming
cyclostrophic balance at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>, we take <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dV_g/dr = 0\)</span> at
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = R_{max}\)</span> to get the adjusted shape parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_g\)</span> as</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[B_g = \frac{(V_{max}^2 + V_{max}R_{max}f)\rho e^\varphi}{\varphi(P_n - P_c)} = B \frac{(1+1/R_o)e^{\varphi - 1}}{\varphi} \quad (9)\]</div>
</center><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\varphi}\)</span> is a scaling parameter introduced to simplify the
derivation process, defined as</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\varphi = \frac{A}{R_{max}^B} \quad \text{or} \quad A = \varphi R_{max}^B \quad (10)\]</div>
</center><p>and later derived as</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\varphi = 1 + \frac{V_{max}R_{max}f}{B_g(V_{max}^2+V_{max}R_{max}f)} = 1 + \frac{1/R_o}{B_g(1+1/R_o)}  \quad (11)\]</div>
</center><p>Thus, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> in the GAHM is not entirely defined by the shape
parameters <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> as in the HM, but also by the scaling factor
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\varphi}\)</span>, as Equation (11) indicates that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\varphi} \ge 1\)</span>.
Numerical solutions for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_g\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\varphi}\)</span> can be solved
iteratively in the model using Equation (9)&amp;(11). Figure 1 illustrates how
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_g/B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi\)</span> vary with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o\)</span> given different
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> values. It is evident that values of both <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_g/B\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi\)</span> remain close to 1 when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o\)</span> is within the range
of [1,2], but increase noticeably as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o\)</span> decreases below 1, and
the smaller the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, the bigger the changes.</p>

shown in different colors.</p>
</center><p>Substituting (9)&amp;(11) back into (1)&amp;(2) yields the final radial pressure and
wind equations for the GAHM</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(r) = P_c + (P_n - P_c)e^{-\varphi(R_{max}/r)^{B_g}} \quad (12)\]</div>
</center><center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V_g(r) = \sqrt{V_{max}^2(1+1/R_o)e^{\varphi(1-(R_{max}/r)^{B_g})}(R_{max}/r)^{B_g} + (\frac{rf}{2})^2} - \frac{rf}{2} \quad (13)\]</div>
</center><p>Influence of the Coriolis force on the radial pressure and wind profiles are
evidenced by the presence of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi\)</span> in (12)&amp;(13). A
special case scenario is when we set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f=0\)</span>, which corresponds to an
infinitely large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span>, then (12)&amp;(13) in the GAHM reduce to (6)&amp;(7) in
the HM. However，for a hurricane with a relatively small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span>, the
influence of the Coriolis force can only be addressed by the GAHM. It meets our
expectation that the GAHM’s solution approaches to that of the HM’s when the
influence of Coriolis force is small, but departs from it when the Coriolis
force plays an important role in the wind system.</p>
<p>The above reasoning can be demonstrated by the 3D plots in Figure 2, which show
the normalized gradient winds of the HM (left panel) and the GAHM (right panel)
as functions of the normalized radial distances <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/R_{max}\)</span>, the Holland
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> parameter, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span>. In both panels, each colored surface
represents the normalized gradient winds corresponding to a unique Holland B
value. By definition, we get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_g = V_{max}\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = R_{max}\)</span>, which
means all the surfaces in each panel should intersect with the plane of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/R_{max} = 1\)</span> on the plane of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_g/V_{max} = 1\)</span>, no matter what
values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span>. However, the line of intersection (shown by the black
line) shown in the left panel deviates from the plane of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_g/V_{max} =1\)</span>
as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o\)</span> decreases from 2 to close to 0 (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span> decreases
from 100 to 1), while remains on the plane regardless of how <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span> changes
in the right panel, demonstrating that the GAHM is mathematically more coherent
than the HM.</p>

</center><p>To have a dissective look of the surface plots in Figure 2, we draw slices
perpendicular to the axis of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o\)</span> at three different values 0,
1, 2, and plot the lines of intersection with each surface in Figure 3. It is
evident that we get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_g = V_{max}\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = R_{max}\)</span> consistently in
the right panel for the GAHM regardless of the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span>. The HM in
the left panel, however, generates distorted wind profiles with underestimated
maximum winds skewed inward towards the storm center, espeically when
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o &lt; 1\)</span>. As a results, when both models being applied to real
hurricane cases, the GAHM will perform more consistently than the HM.</p>

<span id="id6"></span><h2>Calculation of the Radius to the Maximum Wind<a class="headerlink" href="#calculation-of-the-radius-to-the-maximum-wind" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Same with the HM and AHM, the GAHM also uses processed forecast advisories
(during active hurricanes) or best track advisories (post-hurricanes) from the
National Hurricane Center (NHC) in ATCF format as input files, which contain a
time series of storm parameters (usually at 6-hour intervals) such as storm
location, storm movement, central pressure, 1 minute averaged maximum wind,
radii to the 34-, 50-, and/or 64-kt storm isotaches in 4 storm quadrants (NE,
SE, SW, NW), etc. See meteorological input file with NWS = 20 for more details.
As a standard procedure, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_g\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> are pre-computed in
4 storm quadrants for all available isotaches in the ASWIP program  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id15" id="id7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and
appended to the input file prior to running an ADCIRC simulation. The following
describes the procedures to prepare the input file for the GAHM.</p>
<p>First, the influence of the boundary layer effect must be removed to bring the
maximum sustained wind and the 34-, 50-, and/or 64-kt isotaches from 10 meter
height to the gradient wind level. Practically, the maximum gradient wind can be
directly calculated as</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V_{max} = \vert \frac{\overrightarrow{V_M} - \gamma\overrightarrow{V_T}}{W_{rf}} \vert = \frac{V_M - \gamma V_T}{W_{rf}} \quad (14)\]</div>
</center><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overrightarrow{V_M}\)</span> is the reported maximum sustained wind at 10
meter height assuming in the same direction as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overrightarrow{V_T}\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overrightarrow{V_T}\)</span> is the storm translational speed calculated from
successive storm center locations, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{rf} = 0.9\)</span> is the wind reduction
factor for reducing wind speed from the gradient wind level to the surface at 10
meter height (Powell et al., 2003), and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> is the damp factor for
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_T\)</span>. The following formula of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> is employed in the ASWIP
program:</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\gamma = \frac{V_g}{V_{max}} \quad (15)\]</div>
</center><p>which is the ratio of gradient wind speed to the maximum wind speed along a
radial wind profile. Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> is zero at storm center, and increases
with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> until reaches a maximum value of 1 at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>, then
gradually decreases outward to zero.</p>
<p>In addition to the scalar reduction in wind speed, surface friction and
continuity also cause the vortex wind to flow inward across isobars, with an
inward rotation angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> according to the Queensland Government’s
Ocean Hazards Assessment (2001)  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id16" id="id8" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>:</p>

</center><p>Thus, the gradient wind at the radii to specified storm isotaches in 4 storm

<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

</center><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overrightarrow{V_{isot}}\)</span> is the observed isotach wind speed with

<p>Given an initial guess of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>, values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_g\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi\)</span> can be solved iteratively from (9) and (11) until both converge,
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_r\)</span> can be estimated by combining (15), (17), (18), and (19).
Plugging <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{max}\)</span> from (14), the above calculated
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_g, \varphi, V_{max}, V_r\)</span> and the observed radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_r\)</span> to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_r\)</span> back into (13), a new <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> can be inversely solved by a
root-finding algorithm. Since the above calculations are carried out based on an
initial guess of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>, wWe need to repeat the entire process until
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> converges.</p>
<p>In case where multiple isotaches are given in the forecast/best track
advisories, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> for the highest isotach will be calculated using
the above procedure, and used as the pseudo <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> for the entire storm
(physically, there is only one <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> found along a radial wind profile
). For each lower isotach, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> will be calculated with the pseudo
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> set as its initial value to determine the inward rotation angle
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> following the above process only once. The use of the pseudo
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> across all storm isotaches ensures that the cross-isobar
frictional inflow angle changes smoothly along the radius according to (17).</p>
<p>Occasionally, we have to deal with situations where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{max} &lt; V_r\)</span>, which
violate (13) so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> couldn’t be calculated. These situations mostly
happen in the right hand quadrants (in the Northern Atmosphere) of a weak storm
with a relatively high translational speed. For cases like this, we assign
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{max} = V_r\)</span>, which is equivalent to assigning <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max} = R_r\)</span>.</p>
<p>After the ASWIP program finishes processing the input file, it can be readily
used by the GAHM to construct spatial pressure and wind fields in ADCIRC for
storm surge forecast.</p>

<section id="composite-wind-generation">
<span id="id9"></span><h2>Composite Wind Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#composite-wind-generation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Since storm parameters are only given in 4 storm quadrants (assuming at
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(45^\circ, 135^\circ, 225^\circ, 315^\circ\)</span> azimuthal angles,
respectively) at 3 available isotaches in the input file, spatial interpolation
of storm parameters must take place first at each ADCIRC grid node.
Traditionally, the single-isotach approach is used by the AHM, in which storm
parameters will be interpolated azimuthally from the highest isotach only. To
take advantage of the availability of multiple isotaches, a new composite wind
method is introduced in the GAHM, the multiple-isotach approach, in which storm
parameters will be interpolated both azimuthally and radially from all available
isotaches.</p>
<p>To begin, the relative location of a node to the storm center at given time
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is calculated, specified by the azimuth angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> and
distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>. The angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> places the node between two
adjacent quadrants <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i+1\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(quad(i) &lt; \theta \le quad(i+1)\)</span>. For each storm parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> to be
interpolated, its value at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\theta,d)\)</span> are weighted between its values at
two pseudo nodes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((quad(i),d)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((quad(i+1),d)\)</span>:</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(\theta,d)=\frac{P(quad(i),d)(90-\theta)^2+P(quad(i+1),d)\theta^2}{(90-\theta)^2+\theta^2} \quad (20)\]</div>
</center><p>The distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> then places each pseudo node between the radii of two
adjacent isotaches in its quadrant, and the value at the pseudo node is
interpolated using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method:</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(quad,d) = f_{34}P_{34}+f_{50}P_{50}+f_{64}P_{64} \quad (21)\]</div>
</center><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{34}, P_{50}, P_{64}\)</span> are parameter values computed from the 34-,
50-, and 64-isotach, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{34}, f_{50}, f_{64}\)</span> are distance weighting
factors for each isotach, calculated as</p>
<center><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{array}{lll}
\mathrm{I}.  &amp;  r&lt;R_{64}&amp;  f_{64}=1,f_{50}=0,f_{34}=0 \\
\mathrm{II}. &amp; R_{64}\le r&lt;R_{50} &amp;  f_{64}=(r-R_{64})/(R_{50}-R_{64}),f_{50}=(R_{50}-r)/(R_{50}-R_{64}), f_{34}=0 \\
\mathrm{III}. &amp; R_{50}\le r&lt;R_{34} &amp;  f_{64}=0,f_{50}=(r-R_{50}/(R_{34}-R_{50})),f_{34}=(R_{34}-r/(R_{34}-R_{50})) \\
\mathrm{IV}. &amp; r \le R_{34} &amp; f_{64}=0,f_{50}=0,f_{34}=1
\end{array} \quad (22)\end{split}\]</div>
</center><p>and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{34}+f_{50}+f_{64}=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The above procedure is performed at each node of an ADCIRC grid. After all storm
parameters are interpolated, the pressure and gradient winds can be calculated
using (12)&amp;(13). To bring the gradient wind down to the standard 10 meter
reference level, the same wind reduction factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{rf}\)</span> is applied, and
the tangential winds are rotated by an inward flow angle β according to (16).
Then, the storm translational speed is added back to the vortex winds. Last but
not least, a wind averaging factor is applied to convert resulted wind field
from 1-min to 10-min averaged winds in order to be used by ADCIRC. This new
composite wind method is simple and efficient, and more importantly, it assures
that the constructed surface winds match all observed storm isotaches provided
in NHC’s forecast or “best track” advisories.</p>

<p>Besides the maximum wind speed, both Holland <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span> can be

both <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_o\)</span> increase as hurricane strengthens, and decrease
as hurricane dissipates, within the range of (0, 2.5). Previous analytical
evaluation has demonstrated that the GAHM behaves consistently better than the
HM, especially under situations where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o &lt; 1\)</span>. Here, evaluation
of model performance will be carried out by comparing the modeled winds with the
observed winds in the “best track” data, as well as the AHM, the SLOSH (Sea,
Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) winds, re-analysis H*Wind and
hindcast OWI modeled winds. The OWI winds and H*Winds are considered more mature
wind products that are able to resolve more complex structures of a hurricane

<p>It is evident that the radial wind profiles generated by the GAHM consistently
match the highest isotaches in all quadrants at different stages of Irene, no
matter how <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o\)</span> vary. The AHM did a similarly good
job when the hurricane is strong (see middle panels), but failed to match the

<p>Comparisons of the modeled maximum winds and radius to maximum winds to the

lower panels, both color-coded by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o\)</span>, with a simple linear
correlation given in each panel. Examination of the upper panels reveals that
the GAHM did an excellent job in estimating the maximum winds, with a few
overestimations near the lower bound of the dataset. Careful examinations of
these over estimated values revealed that they were from those “bad” dada
entries in the “best track” file that violate certain criteria in the GAHM when
solving for the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>. This phenomenon was particular common during
the dissipating stage of a hurricane. The AHM had larger discrepancies in
estimating the maximum wind compared to the GAHM, especially when
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_{10}R_o &lt; 1\)</span>, which was a direct consequence of the cyclostrophic
balance assumption made during the derivation of HM’s equations. Examination of
the lower panels reveals that the maximum value of the modeled
azimuthally-varying <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> failed to match the observed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>

<p>Earlier we have shown that a radial wind profile constructed by the GAHM using
the single-isotach approach would only match the highest isotach, due to
limitations of this single-fitting method. In fact, underestimations of modeled
winds at distances to isotachs other than the highest one were common, as the
radial wind profile tends to die off too quickly away from the storm center due
to the nature of GAHM’s formulas. In an effort to minimize the combined errors
mentioned above, and to improve the overall accuracy of the estimated wind
field, the multiple-isotach approach should be used whenever there is more than
one isotach present in the best track file.</p>
<p>The 3D plots of Irene’s radial wind profiles (left) and interpolated spatial
wind fields (right) by the GAHM using the single-isotach approach (upper panels)
versus the multiple-isotach approach (lower panels) were given by Figure 7. For
easier visualization, all available isotaches were plotted at radii to specified
isotaches in the left two panels, and as contour lines (after azimuthal
interpolation) in the right two panels. It is evident that winds generated by
the multiple-isotach approach were able to match all given isotaches in all 4
quadrants, while only the highest isotach was matched by the single-isotach
approach. Comparison of the spatial wind fields also indicated that the
multiple-isotach approach allowed the wind to die off more gradually away from
the storm center than the single-isotach approach did, demonstrated by the
smaller gradient of the contour lines in the lower panel. It is believed that
the multiple-isotach approach improves the overall accuracy and performance of
the GAHM.</p>

<li><p><strong>Comparison of Radial Wind Profiles</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using the multiple-isotach approach, radial wind profiles generated from the
GAHM were compared to those from the AHM, the SLOSH, H*Winds, and OWI winds,
shown in Figure 8 at three different stages of Irene (2011), with the left
panels showing the SW to NE cross-section winds, and the right showing the NW to
SE cross-section winds (same as in Figure 5). It is evident that the GAHM’s
composite radial wind profiles matched all available storm isotachs at all time,
while the rest of the models failed most of the time. The SLOSH model, which is
also a parametric wind model, does not take the isotach information to construct
its wind field, so generally did a bad job matching any given isotaches. More
detailed wind structures can be observed from the radial profiles extracted from
the H*Wind and OWI winds than those from the parametric wind profiles, as
expected. However, profiles from different models in general did not match each
other due to different mechanisms involved in each model.</p>

</center><p>Quantitative evaluation of the GAHM’s performance at radii to given isotaches
were given in Figure 9, with statistics given in Table 3, based on all seven
selected hurricanes. The GAHM had almost perfect match to each of the 34-, 50-,
and 64-kt isotaches, with a standard deviation around 0.1 kt, which was very
impressive. The AHM matched the 64-kt isotach reasonably well with a mean of
63.3 kts, but failed at the lower isotaches. The SLOSH did not take any isotach
information to construct its wind fields, thus behaved poorly in matching any
given isotaches. Its data also had the largest spread compared to other models,
with standard deviation ranging from 11 to 16 kts. For the H*Wind and the OWI
winds, the means of modeled winds were close to each specified isotach,
generally within ±3 kts, but the spreads of data were also large compared to
that of the AHM and the GAHM, with a standard deviation greater than 7 kts.</p>

<li><p><strong>Comparison of Spatial Wind fields</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Comparisons of spatial wind fields among the AHM, the GAHM using the
multiple-isotach approach, the SLOSH, H*Wind and OWI winds (in rows) were given
by Figure 10 at the same snapshots (in columns) as in Figure 8. The 34-, 50-,
and 64-kt contour lines were shown in each wind snapshot. In general, the AHM
and GAHM winds shared a lot of similarities. During weaker periods of Irene, the
differences between the AHM and the GAHM’s spatial wind fields were mostly
observed in the inner region of the hurricane due to differences in calculated
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span>. More specifically, the calculated <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> in the AHM
was under-predicted (thus is closer to the storm center) than that in the GAHM,
resulted from the faulty cyclostrophic balance assumption made in the HM and
AHM. During stronger periods of Irene, however, the differences were mostly
observed in the outer region of the hurricane due to the usage of the
multiple-isotach approach in the GAHM. Without taking into account storm
information from lower isotaches, the AHM winds tended to die off too quickly
away from the storm center. The SLOSH winds did not show much similarity to the
AHM and GAHM winds. It used an azimuthally constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{max}\)</span> from the
“best track” file to generate its vortex winds, and a distance-weighted
translational speed to account for storm asymmetry, which was not rendered
properly when the storm was strong. The winds fields of H*Wind and OWI winds
were much more complex than those of the simple parametric models, but the GAHM
did a relatively good job matching the spatial patterns of the hurricane.
Although it is unlikely that the parametric winds constructed over a minimum set
of data would match the level of details and complexity in the re-analysis
H*Wind and the numerical OWI winds, the ability of a the GAHM to produce
reasonable estimates of surface wind fields in a timely manner was highly
desirable for real-time forecasting.</p>
